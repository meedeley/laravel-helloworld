# Hello World Laravel Package

> A package that does exactly what you think it does — it says **Hello World** (wow, groundbreaking).

This is a very serious Laravel package designed for extremely critical situations like saying _hello_ to your users. Just run a command, and boom — your CLI feels loved.

## 💡 What does it do?

- Prints `Hello [name]`
- Knows its own version (which is pretty cool for something that can't think)
- Can be extended or replaced by something actually useful (but we know you won't)

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
composer require meedeley/hello-world
```
